# Manager - Databases

We have the **same database options that a convential strapi application** has:

* PostgreSQL
* MySQL/MariaDB
* SQLite

SQLite is the default database when the strabot manager is created. Feel free to change anytime you want.

> More about how you can change the database here: [Database configuration](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/configurations/required/databases.html#configuration-structure)
